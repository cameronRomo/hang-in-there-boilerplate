## Functionality

### Main Page and Random Posters

- When the page loads, we should see a poster with a randomly selected image, title, and quote.

- When the user clicks the `Show Another Random Poster` button, a new, random poster is generated.Â 

### Make Your Own Poster

![make poster function](https://i.imgur.com/f2mPGaB.gifv)

- After clicking the `Make Your Own Poster` button, users can enter an image URL, a title, and a quote to create their own custom poster.

- Clicking the `Show My Poster` button will return users to the main screen where they will see their custom poster.

### Saving Posters

- From the main screen, users can also click `Save This Poster` to save the poster currently displayed. Users can save the randomly generated posters or posters of their own creation.

- To see the posters a user has saved, they can click on `Show Saved Posters`. This will take them to a screen which shows each of the posters they have saved displayed as miniposters in a grid format.

## Learning Goals

- Write clean, DRY JavaScript to store our data

- Use a provided class by creating object instances using the new keyword

- Manipulate the page after it has loaded: adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM

- Begin to understand how to write effective, clean HTML & CSS

## Wins and Challenges

### Wins

- Successfully interfaced between HTML and JavaScript using the DOM, including adding and updating the elements on the DOM.

- Gained understanding of the importance of utilizing the data model to update the HTML.

- Used provided class to establish a data model.

- Continued learning about HTML and CSS code and syntax.

- Wrote JavaScript code in a clean and DRY manner with respect to where we are at in our learning process. Gained practice with refactoring and code organization.

- Worked in partnership successfully with flexibility and shared responsibility.

- Utilized new-to-us technology via GitHub Projects(kanban), Tuple, Zoom, and GiphyCapture to make our project workflow smoother.

### Challenges

- Our attention to detail while initially reviewing the rubric and directions could be more focused.

- Taking poms in a timely manner.

- Understanding the various interactions in this project:

    - how the DOM interfaces between JS, HTML, and CSS

    - how the data model functions to provide data to the DOM

    - the relationship between CSS and HTML

    - the control flow and how code needs to be organized

- Knowing when we had reached our struggle threshold was tricky at first, but got easier as the project progressed.

- Bridging the knowledge gaps that we still have in Week Two/Three of MOD One was difficult when we came to a concept or functionality that we couldn't articulate. This made asking for help or googling difficult.
